## Build/Run

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v16.13.1 or greater
- NPM v8

### Run the app

For local development, run the app with:

```
npm install
npm run build:oss:watch
```

You can now access the web vault in your browser at `https://localhost:8080`.

If you want to point the development web vault to the production APIs, you can run using:

```
npm install
ENV=cloud npm run build:oss:watch
```

You can also manually adjusting your API endpoint settings by adding `config/local.json` overriding any of the following values:

```json
{
  "dev": {
    "proxyApi": "http://your-api-url",
    "proxyIdentity": "http://your-identity-url",
    "proxyEvents": "http://your-events-url",
    "proxyNotifications": "http://your-notifications-url",
    "allowedHosts": ["hostnames-to-allow-in-webpack"]
  },
  "urls": {}
}
```

Where the `urls` object is defined by the [Urls type in jslib](https://github.com/hitachi-id/bravura-safe_jslib/blob/master/common/src/abstractions/environment.service.ts).

## Prettier

We recently migrated to using Prettier as code formatter. All previous branches will need to updated to avoid large merge conflicts using the following steps:

1. Check out your local Branch
2. Run `git merge 2b0a9d995e0147601ca8ae4778434a19354a60c2`
3. Resolve any merge conflicts, commit.
4. Run `npm run prettier`
5. Commit
6. Run `git merge -Xours 56477eb39cfd8a73c9920577d24d75fed36e2cf5`
7. Push

### Git blame

We also recommend that you configure git to ignore the prettier revision using:

```bash
git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
```
